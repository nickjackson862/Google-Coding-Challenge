- Question 1 - Array Queries -
Given an Array A, with N elements, we need to answer Q queries of the type
  L R: Find the minimum value of abs(A[i] - A[j]) with L ≤ i, j ≤ R and i! = j

Input Format:

◦ First line contains an integer N

◦ Next line contains N space separated integers, denoting elements of A

◦ Next line contains an integer Q

◦ Next Q lines contains two space separated integers L R


Output Format:

◦ Print a single integer, answer to corresponding query in a new line.

Constraints:
◦ 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 300
◦ 1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 10^5
◦ 1 ≤ L < R ≤ N
